Game type and description:
Custom version of flappy bird:  side-scroller game where my bird flies through 
the city and avoids spikes that are separated by random differences.  Additionally,
I added a score and highscore component for the user.  The game contains one level
and can be controlled by the spacebar and/or left mouse button.  The goal is 
to make it between the two spikes without hitting the spikes.

Rubric:
Group Members:  Zachary Durick (no other team members)

Grading Categories:

Team Participation:
1.  Are all grup members on task?
Yes, I was the only member in the group.  I created an outline that consisted of the following:
Game Design - Create the game's story, characters, and visual style.
Programming - Implement player controls, such as movement and jumping.
Art and Animation - Create and design game assets, including characters, environments, objects, and UI elements
Documentation - Documented the C# code and created a README document.

2.  Is there one or more members not contributing to the process?  
Does not apply since I was the only one who created the project.

3.  Does everyone know what is going on with the project?
Yes.


Characters:
1.  What kind and how many characters do you need for the game?
There is only one character and that is the FAPPY bird.

2.  Will you use enemies or traps?
Yes, I chose to use spikes that appear to be inside a cave.

3.  What makes each character distinct from others?
There is only one character.

Level Design:
1.  Are the levels different from one another.
No.
2.  Gameplay can be the same but look to change some of the details about each level.
Only one level and that is to score the highest which is tracked throughout the game - saved to your computer.

3.  How do you finish the level?
The game could last forever in the event you never hit a spike.

Code:

1.  Comment on complex algorithms and student developed procedures
2.  Please make sure your code is readable as well.

Animations:
1.  At least one aspect of your game should be animated:
Characters
Terrain
Buttons
Visuals

Overall Video Game:
1.  Is it enjoyable to play:
Yes, I have fun playing the game everytime I click the start button.

2.  Do the current bugs int eh game take away from the experience?

There is a small bug with the design of the spikes more so with the sprite itself.  I attempted to 
modify the sprite image but it contains a transparent background.  That means that the bird is
triggered (hits the spike) when it his the spike even though the spike is a few millimeters from the
actual spike.  I worked on fixing this but it requires better photoshop skills.
